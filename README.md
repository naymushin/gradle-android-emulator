# Android Emulator Plugin [![Gradle Plugin Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v/https/plugins.gradle.org/m2/com/quittle/android-emulator-plugin/maven-metadata.xml.svg?label=Gradle+Plugin+Version)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.quittle.android-emulator) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/quittle/gradle-android-emulator/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/quittle/gradle-android-emulator/tree/main)

This plugin adds tasks that install an Android emulator and start it up when running instrumentation tests. Includes configuration
for specifying the emulator configuration.

**This plugin will automatically accept all Android SDK licenses when installing the emulator and emulator
system images. Before using the plugin or upgrading Android SDK versions, make sure you are okay accepting the
licenses for those versions.**

## Consumption

The minimum requirement for consumption is to simply
[apply this plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.quittle.android-emulator).

#### build.gradle

```groovy
// Consume from Gradle plugin repository. This is the only required step.
plugins {
    id 'com.quittle.android-emulator' version 'X.X.X'
}

// Consume android plugin as usual.
apply plugin: 'android'

android {
    // Fill out normally
}

// Optional configuration
androidEmulator {
    emulator {
        name 'my_avd_emulator_name' // Defaults to be dynamically based on the configuration of the AVD
        device 'pixel_xl' // Defaults to exclude the device flag, using avdmanager default. For options, run avdmanager list device
        sdkVersion 28 // Defaults to (Target SDK), then (Min SDK), then finally 10
        abi 'x86_64' // Defaults to x86
        includeGoogleApis true // Defaults to false
    }

    enableForAndroidTests false // Defaults to true
    avdRoot '~/.android/avd' // Defaults to be <gradle-build-dir>/android-avd-root
    headless true // Defaults to false but should be set to true for most CI systems
    additionalSdkManagerArguments '--proxy=http', '--proxy_host=56.78.90.12', '--proxy_port=1234' // Additional arguments to pass to the sdkmanager when used to install dependencies. See https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager#options for options
    additionalEmulatorArguments '-no-snapshot', '-http-proxy=localhost:1234' // Additional arguments to pass to the emulator at startup. See https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline#startup-options for options
    logEmulatorOutput true // Defaults to false but can be enabled to have emulator output logged for debugging.
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Emulator failing to start

If the emulator fails to start with an error like

```
Emulator exited abnormally with return code 1
```

and you are unsure what the cause is, set `androidEmulator { logEmulatorOutput true }` and re-run the
gradle build or even just building the `waitForAndroidEmulator` with the `--debug` flag should do the
trick. You should now see the emulator stdout and stderr being logged with error messages if there was
a bad combination of startup flags.

### Custom test task

If you have a reason to run a custom instrumentation test task rather than the default one generated by
the Android Gradle plugin, you can certainly do so. All you must do to ensure the emulator is spun up
and down at the appropriate times is

1. Configure your task to depend on `waitForAndroidEmulator`
2. Configure your task to be finalized by `stopAndroidEmulator`

## Development

In general, perform builds in the context of each folder, rather than as a multi-project Gradle
build. This is necessary because the `example-android-project` will fail to configure without the
plugin being locally available so the `android-emulator-plugin` project must be built and deployed
locally first.

In general, to build and test locally do the following

```
$ ./gradlew -p android-emulator-plugin # This runs all the default tasks
$ ./gradlew -p android-emulator-plugin publishToMavenLocal # Publishes it for the example-android-project to consume
$ ./validate_plugin # Integration test to validate the plugin works
```

## Deployment

This package is deployed via [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/quittle/gradle-android-emulator).
See `.circleci/config.yml` for the CI/CD setup.

In the configuration for the project on CircleCI, `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY` and `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET` are
injected as environment variables.

Upon check-in to the `main` branch, CircleCI checks out and builds the plugin. When a commit is tagged, a new version of
the plugin will be released using the tag version number.
